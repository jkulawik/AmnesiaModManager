# AmnesiaModManager
A simple mod manager for "Amnesia: The Dark Descent" which allows the user to browse and delete installed mods.

Other features:
* Theme settings - light/dark, highlight color, font size

This program was made mostly as practice with test-driven development and a test of the Fyne GUI package,
but it can prove useful in getting rid of old mods easily.

# Usage

Get the program for your system from the releases section and place it in your Amnesia install folder (next to Amnesia.exe).

If you have Go installed, you can also compile it yourself by running `go build .`
